# Here is an example of what we want to take in and output:

## Input:
```python3
for num in range(5):
    print(num)
    power=num**num
    print(power)

while power > 200:
    power -= num
    print(power)
    num += 5
    assert power == power

def func():
    pass

match input():
 case "1":
     print(5)
 case _:
     print("other")
```

## Output:
```python3
for n in range(5):print(n);x=n**n;print(x)
while x>200:x-=n;print(x);n+=5;assert n==n
def f():1
match input():
 case"1":print(5)
 case _:print("other")
```

Currently, we are missing certain checks and things that we would need
to do in order to achieve the desired result.
