# TODO
**Contribute directly to this file if anything is mising!.**

### Formatting ðŸ§¹

- [ ] Prevent extra new lines (particularly for things in parentheses)
- [ ] Remove any spaces around parentheses
- [ ] Remove newline after statements with a single thing in their body (e.g. `if x:b` instead of `if x:<NEWLINE>b`)
- [ ] Replace all possible newlines with `;`. This will likely require extended AST analysis (could be *future* category).

### AST Manipulations ðŸ› 
- [ ] **âš  BLOCKER: Add the ability to manipulate the AST before converting**
- [ ] Merge imports into one line
- [ ] Remove type annotations
- [ ] Rename all variables to `a`, `b`, `c`, etc. (This *could* be implemented in Formatting, but likely *shouldn't*)

### Future Possibilites ðŸ”®
- [ ] "Danger" Mode (allow certain shortens that might harm code execution)
  - [ ] Change all imports to star imports
  - [ ] Remove `assert` statements
- [ ] Switch to a custom AST-based converter with less limitations from SourceGenerator.
  - [ ] This could also free us from the 3-Clause BSD if we wanted to use Unlicense or MIT.

### Completed âœ“
- [x] Basic space removals
- [x] README, TODO
